// The OpenShell gateway release line this build is for, derived from
// deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json.
//
// A dashboard build shares the gateway's minor release line (ADR 0009): a
// build for 0.1 works with every gateway 0.1.x and with no other line. Nobody
// gets to type the line an artifact declares. It is the major.minor of the
// release the pins file names: the one upstream release this branch is built
// on, and the gateway every change is tested against.
//
// This file is the only place that turns the pins into a line. The container
// image's label (ci.yml), the release notes (release.config.cjs) and the
// README's Compatibility section (readme-gateway-range.mjs) all call it, so a
// published artifact cannot claim something CI did not test and two artifacts
// cannot disagree with each other.
//
// One thing restates the line and cannot call this file: the BFF, which has
// the line compiled in so that every image knows it whatever built it
// (BuiltInGatewayReleaseLine in backend/pkg/models/gateway_release_line.go).
// --check holds that constant to the pins.
