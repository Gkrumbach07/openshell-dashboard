#   scripts/dev-env.sh logs            follow the gateway's and Keycloak's logs  (make dev-logs)
#   scripts/dev-env.sh down            stop it; the gateway's data stays         (make dev-down)
#   scripts/dev-env.sh reset           stop it, delete its data and its sandboxes (make dev-reset)
#
# make dev, make dev-full and the compat targets first call `ports`, which
# stops when a port they listen on is taken. make dev and make dev-full take
# the BFF's settings from `env`, and make dev-full runs `proxy` (the auth
# proxy, on this machine, in front of the UI dev server). The compat targets
# end with `compat-clean`, which removes what their gateway kept.
#
# The stack is deploy/dev/compose.yaml. With sign-in it also serves make dev:
# the gateway accepts a call without a token and checks one that is sent.
#
# Needs docker with compose, jq, openssl and curl; `proxy` needs go.
# Environment:
#   DEV_STATE_DIR   where the generated files go (default scripts/.state/local).
#                   The Docker daemon must be able to mount it: with colima, a
#                   directory under your home directory.
#   DOCKER_SOCK     the Docker socket as the daemon sees it (default
#                   /var/run/docker.sock).
