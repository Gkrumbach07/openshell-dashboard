# ADR 0005: Gateway compatibility and releases

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-10-11

Terms follow OpenShell's [RFC 0014](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/tree/main/rfc/0014-release-stability): stable release, pre-release, patch and minor release, minor release line, Stable interface. A minor release line is every release that shares a major and a minor number, written `0.1` and shown as `0.1.x`.

## Context

The SDK the BFF is compiled with and the gateway image are the client half and the server half of one OpenShell tree at some commit. When the two halves do not match, the failure is not a clean error. A gateway 0.0.116 answers a dashboard built for 0.1 with `workspace '\n\adefault' not found` on every workspace-scoped call, because it reads a serialized message as a workspace name; another mismatch drops a request field without any error.

## Decisions

1. **The dashboard shares the gateway's minor release line.** Any dashboard 0.1.x works with any gateway 0.1.x. The two patch numbers are independent. To know whether a dashboard works with a gateway, compare the first two numbers of their versions. There is no table of minimum and maximum versions. Dashboard X.Y.0 means "compatible with gateway X.Y.x"; it does not mean every gateway feature is in the UI yet.
2. **A gateway minor release requires a dashboard minor release.** Dashboard X.Y.0 starts the matching line. It is not released until the compatibility suite passes against a gateway of that line, and that gateway line has no dashboard in the meantime. No release is cut from a commit whose compatibility suite failed. A gateway feature the dashboard cannot support yet is left out or marked unsupported, never shipped broken.
3. **On a gateway patch release the dashboard moves to it and releases a patch.** Dashboards already installed keep working without it. If the compatibility suite fails against the new gateway release, the dashboard stays on the last one that passed until it is fixed.
4. **The dashboard's own releases are patch releases.** Between gateway releases it publishes patch releases for fixes and features. It never starts a minor on its own.
5. **The line before the current one gets critical and security fixes, from `release/<major>.<minor>`, for as long as the gateway maintains the same line.** Nothing else is backported.
6. **A branch is built on one OpenShell release, and every change is tested against it.** `deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json` names the release: its gateway and supervisor images by digest, and the SDK at the commit of its tag, which is the version `backend/go.mod` requires. `main` and `release/<major>.<minor>` pin a stable release; `next` is the only branch that pins a pre-release; no gateway or SDK is pinned to `dev`, `latest` or `@latest`. Each link has its own proof. Gateway and SDK: the compatibility suite in `backend/test/compat`, run against the real gateway with `-count=1`. SDK and BFF: the compiler, `go vet` and the unit tests. BFF and UI: both are built from one commit into one image. A failure is reported as the link it is.
7. **New gateway releases are picked up from the gateway's release tags, and moving to one is one commit.** The gateway images, the SDK, the release line compiled into the BFF when the minor changes, and the README's generated table move together. The Follow upstream workflow makes that commit, on the `next` branch. On `main` and `next` nobody makes it by hand.
8. **Gateway pre-releases are tested before the stable release, in two ways.** Check A runs the dashboard as `main` builds it against the upcoming gateway; a failure is one issue, rewritten in place and closed when the check passes again. Check B is CI on the pull request from `next`: the dashboard built on the upcoming SDK against the upcoming gateway. Work that needs the upcoming release is done on `next`, which merges into `main` when the gateway releases.
9. **The dashboard says so when the gateway is on another line.** Three verdicts: *supported* when the gateway's major and minor number are the dashboard's line (any patch release of the line, and any pre-release, development build or rebuild of one); *unsupported* for any other line, older or newer; *unknown* when the gateway reports no version that can be read, or the BFF's own line cannot be read. The line is compiled into the BFF, so every image knows it whatever built it. The verdict informs and blocks nothing.
10. **The one requirement on OpenShell: no breaking change to a Stable interface within a minor release line,** as RFC 0014 proposes. The dashboard is tested on one release of its line and claims the whole line; the difference rests on this.
11. **The version of a release is computed, and a release is started by a person.** The version is `<line>.<n>`: the line of the pinned release, then one more than the highest patch among the release tags `v<line>.*`, or `0` when the line has none. Nobody chooses it and no commit title changes it. A person starts the release workflow on `main` or on `release/<major>.<minor>`; a dry run is the default; the commit needs a green CI run, and the image released is the one that run built, given more tags. One release is automatic: the merge of `next`, recognised by where the commit came from and not by its title.
12. **Gateway 0.0.116 is served by one release outside the numbering, `gateway-0.0.116`.** No build works with both 0.0.116 and 0.1.x, and gateway 0.0.x releases were not compatible with each other, so a dashboard version 0.0.x would claim too much. No further release is planned for it.

## Alternatives

- *Track `latest`.* Nobody tested what `latest` was on the day.
- *Declare a minimum and a maximum gateway version per release.* The answer has to be looked up in a table, and every gateway patch newer than the maximum reads as untested although nothing is known to be wrong with it.
- *Promise the last N gateway releases unconditionally.* A wire break makes some promises impossible to keep; what works has to be found by running it.
- *Move the SDK and the gateway separately.* Both come from one OpenShell tag; moving them apart doubles the pull requests and proves combinations nobody ships.
- *Let commit titles choose the version.* Choosing a title becomes the same act as publishing.
- *No automatic release at all.* The move to a new gateway release is the release most likely to be forgotten.

## Consequences

- A reader needs two numbers, not a table.
- The dashboard claims more than it tests. If a gateway patch release breaks a Stable interface, installed dashboards break with it, and the remedy is a fix on either side.
- The compatibility suite proves only what it varies. A request field the gateway silently drops fails nothing, and the field-by-field diff of request messages that would show it is not run automatically.
- The line is written twice, in the pins file and in the BFF's source, and CI holds the two together.
- Releases batch: everything merged since the last release goes out together, and someone has to remember to cut one.
- A release branch is created by the workflow and kept up to date by a person.
- See [`docs/releasing.md`](../releasing.md) for cutting a release and [`deploy/ci/upstream/README.md`](../../deploy/ci/upstream/README.md) for the Follow upstream workflow.
