# Development

How to run the dashboard from a checkout, test it, and find your way around the code. To install it on a cluster, see [install.md](install.md).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26.7 or newer (`backend/go.mod`), Node 22.
- Docker with Compose, `jq`, `openssl` and `curl`: the local gateway and the compat suite run in Docker, which also builds the image.
- For `make lint`, [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) v2 built with Go 1.26.7 or newer; an older build stops before it lints. CI runs v2.12.2.

## Run it locally

```sh
make setup      # once: the frontend and Go dependencies
make gateway    # the OpenShell release this branch pins, in Docker
make dev        # the UI on http://localhost:3000 and the BFF on port 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and choose **Continue as developer**. Sign-in is off: you are `dev-user`, a platform admin, and the BFF forwards no token. The UI reloads on a change; restart `make dev` after a Go change.

With sign-in, in place of the last two:

```sh
make dev-full   # also Keycloak, with the realm of deploy/keycloak/, and the auth proxy
```

Open `http://localhost:4180`, not the port 3000 the dev server prints. The command prints the password of `admin1`, a platform admin, and `user1`, and the subject by which `admin1` adds `user1` to a workspace under **Members**; `scripts/dev-env.sh status` prints them again. The first run pulls Keycloak and builds the auth proxy; the first sandbox pulls a 4 GB image.

- **Stop.** Ctrl-C, then `make dev-down`. `make dev-reset` also deletes the gateway's data; run it before you delete the checkout.
- **Logs.** `make dev-logs` follows the gateway and Keycloak.
- **Docker.** The gateway runs on the daemon `docker` talks to (`docker context ls`). Tested on colima on macOS only; there, keep the checkout under your home directory.
- **No gateway at all.** `make dev-mock` serves the UI from fixtures, with no BFF or gateway running; `make dev-mock-empty` is a gateway nobody has used yet. See [The mock API](mock-api.md).
- **A gateway of your own.** For `make dev`, skip `make gateway` and export its address and certificates first ([Connecting to a gateway outside the chart](configuration.md#connecting-to-a-gateway-outside-the-chart)).

## Make targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | `npm install` in `frontend/`, `go mod download` in `backend/` |
| `make gateway`, `dev`, `dev-full`, `dev-logs`, `dev-down`, `dev-reset` | [Run it locally](#run-it-locally) |
| `make dev-mock`, `dev-mock-empty` | The UI alone, on [the mock API](mock-api.md) |
| `make test` | `go test ./...` and Jest |
| `make lint` | ESLint, the Prettier check and golangci-lint |
| `make typecheck`, `make format` | `tsc --noEmit`; Prettier, writing the files |
| `make build` | The container image, with `docker build` |
| `make compat` | [The compat suite](#the-compat-suite) |
| `make helm-lint`, `helm-test`, `helm-docs` | [The Helm chart](#the-helm-chart) |

## Tests

- **Unit tests.** `make test` runs the Go tests in `backend/` and Jest in `frontend/`.
- **UI tests with stubbed API responses.** In `frontend/`, run `npm start` in one terminal, then `npm run e2e` (or `npm run e2e:open`) in another. [`frontend/cypress/README.md`](../frontend/cypress/README.md) has the details.
- **Release and CI tooling.** `node --test "scripts/**/*.test.mjs"` and `python3 -m unittest discover -s deploy/ci/upstream`.

## The compat suite

The compatibility suite, `compat` for short, is `backend/test/compat`: Go tests that drive the BFF's REST API against a real gateway. It has the build tag `compat`, so `go test ./...` does not run it.

```sh
make compat                            # against the gateway this branch pins
OPENSHELL_VERSION=0.1.2 make compat    # against another gateway release, by its tag
```

`make compat` starts a gateway of its own, on port 8080, builds the BFF, runs the suite and removes the gateway and its data.

A unit test with a stand-in for the SDK cannot see a gateway that reads a request differently, so the suite runs against the pinned gateway on every pull request ([How it is tested](compatibility.md#how-it-is-tested)).

## Building the image

```sh
make build
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_URL=https://gateway.example.com:17670 \
  -e AUTH_DISABLED=true \
  openshell-dashboard:latest
```

A gateway with a private CA or a client certificate also needs the files mounted and the [TLS](configuration.md#tls) variables set. This build passes no build arguments, so the image's `gateway.line` and `sdk` labels are empty and **Help → About** shows no commit. The compatibility notice still works: the release line is compiled into the BFF.

## The Helm chart

- `make helm-lint` lints and renders the chart with its defaults and with each `ci/values-*.yaml` on its own.
- `make helm-test` runs the chart's unit tests. It needs the [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest) plugin.
- `make helm-docs` regenerates the chart's `README.md` from `README.md.gotmpl` and the `# --` comments in `values.yaml`, with helm-docs 1.14.2 run through mise (`mise.toml`). Do not edit the generated file: CI fails when it differs from what helm-docs writes.

## Layout

```

  src/app/           shell: App.tsx, routes (AuthenticatedRoutes.tsx, AppRoutes.tsx), layout, session

deploy/              Dockerfile, Helm chart (helm/), Keycloak realm (keycloak/), local stack (dev/), compat stack and gateway pins (ci/)
scripts/             release and CI tooling, dev-env.sh (the local stack)

tasks/, mise.toml    the helm-docs task `make helm-docs` runs
.github/workflows/   CI (ci.yml), releases (publish.yml), Follow upstream (follow-upstream.yml)
docs/                these documents and the ADRs (adrs/)
```

The conventions for each part are in `.claude/rules/`: [`react.md`](../.claude/rules/react.md), [`bff-go.md`](../.claude/rules/bff-go.md), [`openshell-api.md`](../.claude/rules/openshell-api.md) and [`security.md`](../.claude/rules/security.md). UI text is covered in [`frontend/src/i18n/README.md`](../frontend/src/i18n/README.md).

A [feature flag](configuration.md#feature-flags) reaches the UI in `GET /api/v1/auth/config`. `useFeatureFlags()` in `frontend/src/api/auth.ts` returns the flags, each as on until that answer has arrived. A navigation entry names its flag (`featureKey`, in `navEntries` in `frontend/src/app/AppLayout.tsx`); a tab or an action asks the hook:

```tsx
const features = useFeatureFlags();
{features.terminal && <Tab eventKey="terminal" title={<TabTitleText>Terminal</TabTitleText>} />}
```

## Branches and the pinned OpenShell release

A branch is built on one OpenShell release, which `deploy/ci/gateway-pins.json` names: `main` on a stable release, `next` on the upcoming one. Which branch a change goes to is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#where-a-pull-request-goes), and how the pinned release moves is in [`deploy/ci/upstream/README.md`](../deploy/ci/upstream/README.md).
